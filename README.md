# Book-Club

Summary:

RoundTable is an online book club that allows the user to discuss the current book of the month with other users, leave ratings and choose the following months book up for discussion.

Features:

Discussion:
This section allows the user to leave comments and talk to other members of the book club about the current book.

Rating:
The image of the book up for discussion is displayed and the user is prompted to give it a rating of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Ratings will be displayed for other users to see.

Next Read:
A predetermined selection of books are displayed for the user to choose from and are prompted through the poll for their choice. In future updates, we hope to incorporate a time feature so that the poll will finish by the end of the month, and the poll winner will be chosen.
